\chapter{Automatic Speech Recognition of Ear-Recorded Speech\label{chapter3}}


\section{Introduction}



\section{Background}

% Things to hit on:
% - Traditional general ASR mechanics?
% - Outline problem of noise in the signal
% - Traditional methods of filtering noise out of the signal
% - Previous methods of ASR in noise
% -- Issues with these traditional methods (of removing noise and ASR in noise)
% - Current methods of ASR
% - Current methods of ASR in noise (Li 2014, and more current)
% -- Multiple Microphones and Beamforming
% -- Other methods??  Look at current CHiME challenge papers
% - Try to find continued issue with electronically identifying speech in noise
% - Emphasize unpredictability of noise, and unknown amplitude - how ear-recorded speech may be able to `protect' against this unpredicatability
