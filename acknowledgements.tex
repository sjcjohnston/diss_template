My first thanks goes to my committee, who have all inspired and guided this research throughout its many stages from when it began as a seed of an idea.  To my advisor, Mike Hammond, whose support never wavered, to Natasha Warner, whose statistical and phonetic advice was invaluable.  To Brad Story, who was an inspiration in the classes I took with him and a never-ending trove of signal processing information.  To David Velenovsky, whose enthusiasm for the project, audiological advice, and generous lending of critical equipment was extremely appreciated.  Their support for this project was critical; any errors are my own. A great deal of gratitude is also extended to all who served as participants for this work, without whom none of this would be possible.

Much appreciation is also extended to the High Performance Computing services at the University of Arizona, in particular the technical help and advice offered by Mike Bruck, and those who in part responsible for funding this service, VP of Information Strategy and University Libraries Karen Williams and Senior Vice President for Research Kimberly Espy.  Without this support, the computational portion of this thesis may never have been finished.

Many thanks to the Department of Linguistics, for fostering a supportive and educational environment, and to those colleagues in the Department and the university in general.  Particularly those who have offered help and advice pertaining to signal processing and speech (Megan Willi), automatic speech recognition (Josh Meyer, Michael Capizzi), statistics (Shannon Grippando), and programming (Gustave Hahn-Powell, Becky Sharp, Kristen Howe, Trevor Sullivan).  Thanks to Diana Archangeli and Andrew Carnie who have provided me with advice, support, and many adventures during my graduate years.  To my undergraduate mentors, Heather Blakemore, Melinda Reichelt, and Janeil Page.

Untold amounts of gratitude to my friends (Bo, Gabby, Ben, Heidi, Shannon, Karissa, Justin, Kyle and so many others) for providing emotional, spiritual, and at times physical support before and during graduate school.  Also to my family and family-in-laws, especially to my parents and sisters, and their support over the last 22 years of my education.

And to Jennifer, my wife, without whom I would never have made it.
